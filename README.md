## Process
- Imported Raw Data: Loaded the messy "Mobile Sales Data" Excel file into Power BI using the Power Query Editor for transformation.
  
- Data Cleaning in Power Query:
     - Removed null and duplicate records
     - Renamed inconsistent column headers (e.g., “Customer Ratings” → “Ratings”)
     - Changed data types (e.g., Date fields, Age as whole number)
     - Split or merged columns where needed (e.g., combining Day, Month, Year into a single Date column)
       
- Closed & Applied: Applied all transformations and loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI's data model.
 
- Built Visuals: Created various visuals like bar charts, pie charts, cards, and line graphs to represent sales, ratings, brand performance, and customer demographics.
 
- Added Filters & Slicers: Implemented slicers for Brand, City, and Payment Method to enable dynamic user interactions.
